- [Explore SCN2A mutations collected from Sanders et al 2018](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/joonan30/bsms222_123_an/blob/master/analyze_scn2a_mutations.nb.html) ([raw file](https://github.com/joonan30/bsms222_123_an/blob/master/analyze_scn2a_mutations.Rmd)). This is a tutorial for autodidact who just finished the Rafa book's chapter 3 and 4.  

- Explore gene annotations for the human genome. This is a tutorial for the chapter 5, tidyverse. Here we deal with many cases in data munging for gene annotations. It is a welcoming kit for modern biologists. 

- Explore SCN2A mutations from general population. This will be an assignment for students and draw their own plots from the dataset followed by peer review.
